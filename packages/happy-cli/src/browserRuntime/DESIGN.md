# Browser Runtime (Agent Browser PoC)

Plan/spec: Saydo `specs/agent-browser-poc/` (spec, plan, contracts, acceptance).
This file records the implementation decisions made at T01 and the module
boundaries. `contracts.ts` is the typed version of the plan's contract.

## T01 findings that shaped this

- Agent sessions are spawned by the Happy daemon as detached children
  (`daemon/run.ts` spawnSession). Nothing aborts a turn when the Desktop client
  disconnects; only abort/stop/archive/idle-reaper end it. Follow-up messages go
  through the server (`POST /v3/sessions/:id/messages`, `happy agent prompt`).
- Existing `mcp__happy__browser_*` tools go session MCP → daemon `/browser/request`
  → extension WebSocket. A missing `tabId` falls back to the active tab inside
  the extension (`protocol.js` resolveTab).
- No SQLite dependency; durable state elsewhere uses temp-file + fsync + rename
  + directory fsync (`checkpoint/checkpointTurnApplyJournal.ts`). `node:sqlite`
  is unavailable on the supported Node 20 floor, so TaskStore reuses that
  pattern (no new dependency).
- Agents are not sandboxed by default and can read `~/.happy`. Runtime secrets
  therefore never live under `~/.happy` and never on the agent's host
  filesystem: the Runtime, Chromium, profile and journal run in Linux
  containers; the host only holds an agent grant (whose power equals the agent
  tool surface) and the harness issuer key under a harness-only directory.

## Topology (PoC substitute for "separate Linux execution machine")

## Modules (src/browserRuntime)

| File | Responsibility | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| contracts.ts | IDs, DTOs, error codes, limits, driver port, API port | I/O |
| taskStore.ts | durable task/action/approval/event records, dedupe, seq, writer lock + fencing, quota | know about CDP |
| stateMachine.ts | pure transition rules (status × event → status), pause reasons | I/O |
| inputLease.ts | per-tab owner/epoch/segment, profile-wide user fence | persist by itself |
| policy.ts | origin allowlist, fixture action risk classes, approval binding hash, redaction | trust page text |
| auth.ts | grant/capability sign+verify, revocation list | accept identity from request JSON |
| runtime.ts | BrowserRuntimeApi: all operations, batch worker, cancel fence, recovery | hold a lock across driver awaits |
| drivers/cdpDriver.ts | explicit target CDP driver, OOPIF, refs, screenshot, trusted input | active-tab fallback, Runtime.evaluate exposure |
| server.ts / runtimeMain.ts | HTTP transport, health, single instance | business rules |
| agentTools.ts | MCP tool surface for the agent (claude/utils/startHappyServer wiring) | approve/takeOver |

Harness and fixture: `scripts/browser-poc/` (fixture server, container images,
runner, A01–A12 scenarios). Unit tests next to modules (`*.test.ts`, unit
project). Browser E2E suites are `src/browserRuntime/e2e/*.poc.test.ts` in the
`browser-poc` vitest project (needs docker).

## As built (2026-09-25)

- Each browser container sits on its own network (`abp-<run>-a` / `-b`); the Runtime and
  the fixture join both, so a browser or page can never reach the other profile's CDP.
  The CDP proxy accepts only `Host: browser-<profile>:9223`; noVNC needs a per-run password.
- Owned tabs are opened as background windows (a background tab in the user's window is
  hidden in a headful browser and cannot be captured). Cost: per-window browser UI memory
  (see Saydo results, A12 soak).
- Refs resolve only against snapshots the agent received; dispatch-time checks use
  `describeRef` (no new snapshot). Approvals persist a structural element identity so a
  pending approval survives a Runtime-only restart when document and node are unchanged.
- Writer lock = heartbeat lease (5 s refresh, stale after 20 s) + fencing token;
  `runtimeMain` waits for a dead writer's lease to expire before giving up.
- Acceptance results, gates and the No-go verdict: Saydo `specs/agent-browser-poc/results.md`.
